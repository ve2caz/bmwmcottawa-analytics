## Result Description

The engagement scores for each event category were calculated from active member participation in calendar events since the inception of the club's use of Club Express.

The scores reflect the relative popularity and member involvement in each type of event. Higher scores indicate greater engagement, suggesting that events like Road Rides and Club Meetings are particularly well-received by members. Conversely, events such as Café Clubs and Tours have lower engagement scores, indicating less member interest or participation.

The results are sorted from most popular to least popular. The low scores indicate that only a subset of club members participate in or register for events such as club meetings.

To obtain more accurate data, it would be necessary for club members to register for all activities they participate in and to cancel their registration if they do not attend.
